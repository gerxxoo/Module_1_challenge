Brex: New Age Corporate Banking

## Overview and Origin

Brex is an online banking company that offers a small variety of critical business operations services such as corprate cards, bill payment, and expense management. The company was incorporated on 1/3/17 and is based out of San Francisco. Brex was founded by Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi, who met on Twitter who "met through a spirited Twitter exchange when they were high school seniors in Brazil" (Forbes). In 2013, the newfound friends launched Pagar.me which was a Brazilian version of Stripe. They sold the company in 2016 and launched Brex in 2017. The duo was already in a the fintech space with Pagar.me and had the vision of creating a new company that provided corporate bank accounts. They soon found a more viable route in corporate credit cards because as Forbes quotes Dubugras, "What business would trust their money to these random 22-year-old Brazilians? With corporate credit cards...we're giving them money instead of asking for their own." Brex has a valuation of $12.3 billion. Crunchbase reports a total funding of $1.5 billion over twelve rounds of funding from numerous investors. 


## Business Activities

Brex began with the goal to provide comprehensible online banking for copmanies and coporations. After realizing that it is better suited to provide credit card services, Brex saw an opportunity. The company could already see where speding was taking place, so it integrated a cost management system. The data Brex collects allows its users to make better business decisions and "manage the the spending of scaling enterprise" (Bloomberg). PitchBook explains, "The company's offering eliminates the need to supply social security numbers or credit scores and is supported by an integrated software suite that reduces employee time spent on cost management, accounting, and budgeting, enabling entrepreneurs to protect their personal credit without restricting their capital." 

Brex's inteded customers were intially businesses of all sizes and maturities. In December of 2021, the copmany decided to focus on startups with institutional investor-backing or classified as midmarket and drop small businesses. Companies across the board suffered instensely in 2020; companies were forced to focus on profitability. This caused Brex's customer service lines to be bombarded including calls from "several of Brexâ€™s largest clients...asking for solutions to assist them manage costs and hire less expensive foreign staff" (EnvZone). 

Brex offers a more holistic approach to their services. Ramp, their main competitor, offers corporate cards, expense management, and vendor management, but Brex also offers business travel management with integrated online booking and event management. Navan is a copmetitor that offers travel management but focuses in this space. Another major selling point for Brex is its artificial intelligence software. This can answer simple questions such as what the spending limit is or can help with certain operations and policy compliance. A client employee can book a flight and have Brex Assistant send a push notification with the policies to follow. If a dinner took place during the event, for example, Brex Assistant will autopopulate a receipt with the data gathered from the transaction and will even formulate a relevant memo to attach to the transaction. This is a way that Brex saves their clients time via automation. The technologies that allow Brex to provide services like these include React, Amazon S3, Amazon Web Services, Amazon CloudFront, and Gatsby.


## Landscape

Brex mainly participates in the enterprise solutions domain but has a presence in the open banking domain as well. Brex is not a chartered bank so it works with several banks to keep deposits in "money market and/or FDIC-insured accounts" such as JP Morgan (Forbes). According to MasterCard, "global fintech venture capital funding [saw] a 38% year-over-year decrease in the second half of 2022," which signals tightening and a shift in metrics and trends. The first is "shifting to sustainable business models" (MasterCard). Attracting the most amount of customers is no longer the goal. Now companies must hone in on a niche and really define the market they want to serve. This is exactly what happened to Brex and why they dropped small businesses. Another trend is the drive to create super-apps that provide a one-stop-shop environment for customers. In other words, a single service provider can handle most, if not all, the needs of their customers. From a business enterprise standpoint, Brex is on this trend by providing banking solutions and handling expenses in an automated fashion. Brex allows synchronization with QuickBooks and Expensify, for example. Some of the major players in the enterprise solutions domain include Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, and IBM.
