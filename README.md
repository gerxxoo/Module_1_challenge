Brex: New Age Corporate Banking

## Overview and Origin

Brex is an online banking company that offers a small variety of critical business operations services such as corprate cards, bill payment, and expense management. The company was incorporated on 1/3/17 and is based out of San Francisco. Brex was founded by Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi, who met on Twitter who "met through a spirited Twitter exchange when they were high school seniors in Brazil" (Forbes). In 2013, the newfound friends launched Pagar.me which was a Brazilian version of Stripe. They sold the company in 2016 and launched Brex in 2017. The duo was already in a the fintech space with Pagar.me and had the vision of creating a new company that provided corporate bank accounts. They soon found a more viable route in corporate credit cards because as Forbes quotes Dubugras, "What business would trust their money to these random 22-year-old Brazilians? With corporate credit cards...we're giving them money instead of asking for their own." Brex has a valuation of $12.3 billion. Crunchbase reports a total funding of $1.5 billion over twelve rounds of funding from numerous investors.
